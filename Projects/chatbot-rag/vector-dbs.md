# Vector Databases
Reasons for high performance

## Indexing for NN search
- Specialized indexing structures that are designed specifically for fast ANN (Approximate NN) search. 
  - No exhaustive searches like in traditional DBs. 
- Indexing in traditional DBs are not designed for computing metrics like cosine similarity or euclidean distance. 

## Native metric support
- Natively support search with embedding similarity metrics. 

## Memory and storage optimizations
- Use techniques like quantization and compression to store dense vectors.
