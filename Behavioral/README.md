## **Tips for Answering Behavioral Questions**
1. **Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)** to structure your answers clearly and concisely.
2. Highlight **quantifiable results** whenever possible (e.g., “reduced model inference time by 30%” or “increased system uptime by 20%”).
3. Tailor your examples to **align with the company’s mission and job requirements**.
4. Be prepared to back up your claims with **specific technical details** if probed.
5. Default to STAR: Behavioral interviews are designed to assess how you’ve handled situations in the past, so specific experiences are almost always better.
6. Pivot When Needed: For questions about philosophy or approach, briefly outline your general method and follow up with a STAR example.
7. Avoid Being Vague: A purely general answer might sound rehearsed or theoretical, which won’t leave a strong impression.
