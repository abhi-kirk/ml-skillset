# Derivatives
- *Intuition*: For a function $f(x)$, when nudged by a small amount, how does the function responds? Does it go up/down? What is the slope magnitude and direction at that point?
- *Numerical Approx of slope/gradient*: $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$, where $h\rightarrow 0$.  
  - To minimize the function we want to find the value of $x$ where this slope is 0. 
  - Hence we take the gradient of $f(x)$ w.r.t. $x$; this is the direction where the function is increasing. 
  - Hence we move/nudge $x$ in the negative direction of the gradient.
