# ML Security

## Model Robustness
- Ensemble models: Reduce the impact of single-model vulnerabilities. 
- Fine-tune public models for specific use-case.
- Data augmentations: Add noise, perturbation, and transformations to training data.  
- Regularize models: Reduce overfitting with L1/L2, dropouts, weight decay. 
- ML input and output validation checks. 

## Data Robustness
- Sensitive data handling. 
- Secure data ingestion pipelines. 
- Monitoring data distribution drifts. 

## ML System Vulnerabilities
- Adversarial attacks with corrupted data. 
- Unauthorized access. 
- Unencrypted model files and artifacts.
