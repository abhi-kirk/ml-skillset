# Learning to Rank (LTR)

LTR stands for Learning to Rank, which refers to a set of machine learning techniques aimed at training models to produce optimal rankings for a given set of items (e.g., documents, products, search results). The goal of LTR is to learn a ranking function that orders items in a way that maximizes a specific ranking metric, such as NDCG, MAP, or Precision@k.

## Why Use LTR?
Ranking problems are common in information retrieval systems, search engines, and recommendation systems. Instead of manually defining rules for ranking, LTR uses labeled training data to learn the optimal ranking function.

## Types of LTR Approaches
LTR methods can be categorized into three types based on how they treat the ranking task:
- Pointwise Approach
  - Treats ranking as a regression or classification problem for each individual item.
  - Example: Predict the relevance score of each document independently.
  - Objective: Minimize prediction error for individual documents.
  - Pros: Simple and intuitive.
  - Cons: Does not directly model ranking relationships between items.

- Pairwise Approach
  - Considers pairs of items and learns to predict which one should be ranked higher.
  - Example: RankNet, which minimizes pairwise loss based on predicted preferences between two documents.
  - Objective: Minimize the number of inversions (incorrectly ranked pairs).
  - Pros: Models relative order between items.
  - Cons: Computationally expensive for large datasets.

- Listwise Approach
  - Directly optimizes a ranking metric (e.g., NDCG or MAP) for the entire ranked list.
  - Example: LambdaMART, which optimizes a listwise objective using boosted trees.
  - Objective: Maximize the quality of the entire ranking list.
  - Pros: Most effective when the ranking metric is the final evaluation goal.
  - Cons: More complex to implement and train.

## Applications of LTR
- Search Engines: Ranking web pages based on their relevance to a query.
- Recommendation Systems: Ranking products, movies, or content for users.
- Ad Placement: Ranking advertisements based on click-through probabilities.
- Question Answering: Ranking answers based on relevance to a query.

## Example Workflow for LTR
- Data Collection:
  - Create labeled data with relevance scores (e.g., 0 for irrelevant, 1 for relevant).
  - Group data by query or context (e.g., documents associated with a query).
- Feature Engineering:
  - Compute features for query-document pairs (e.g., BM25 scores, embedding similarities).
- Model Training:
  - Use an LTR model like RankNet, LambdaMART, or xgboost.XGBRanker.
- Evaluation:
  - Assess the model using ranking metrics such as NDCG, MAP, or Precision@k.
- Deployment:
  - Use the trained model to rank items in real-world applications.
