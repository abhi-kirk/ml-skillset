**Brute Force**
- Iterate over first and second arrays to find a match, and set a flag. 
- If flag is True (i.e. a match was previously found), and the current second loop element is greater than the first loop element, add it to the list and return. 
- If reached end of second array, break from second loop. 
- Time Complexity: $O(m.n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**Better Brute Force**
- Convert second array to a hash map. 
- Outer loop is first array. 
- Inner loop starts from the second array index (value) corresponding to the hash map key for the outer loop element. 
  - This avoids scanning the entire second array. 
- Time Complexity: $O(m.n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.

**Monotonous Stack**
- Objective is to create a dictionary of key, value pairs such that keys are all elements in the second array, and their corresponding values are their next greatest elements in the array. 
- Hence, we iterate over the second array, and:
  - The first element is pushed to the stack by default. 
  - We try to find the next greatest element for the top of the stack by comparing it with the current iteration element. 
    - If current element is less than the top of the stack, then we have failed, and hence we push the current element to the top of the stack as well. 
    - If current element is greater than the top of the stack, then we have succeeded in finding the next greatest element for the top of the stack, and hence:
      - We pop the stack and insert the popped element and the current element in the dictionary as key and value, respectively. 
      - We keep popping until the current element is smaller than the top of the stack, or stack is empty. 
    - If the top of stack is empty, we push the current element to the stack (to try to find its greatest element in subsequent iterations). 
  - If we reach the end of the array and there are still elements left in the stack, then that means there are no greatest elements that exist, hence we pop them and insert into the dictionary with values -1. 
- We iterate over the first array, and create a list with the values from dictionary after matching the keys to the first array elements. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
