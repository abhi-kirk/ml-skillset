**Track Meeting Rooms**
- *Intuition*: With the meeting rooms sorted, track a list of meeting rooms required with elements as meeting end times. 
  - For each new meeting room, check the meeting room end times list for available room. 
  - If available room exists, update the meeting room end times list value for the available room. 
  - If no available room, add another room to the meeting room end times list. 
  - Return the length of the list. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n\log n) + O(n.m)$, where $n$ is the number of `intervals`, and $m$ is the number of meeting rooms used. 
  - Worst case: $O(n^2)$ when $m=n$ (all meetings require separate rooms). 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.

**Min-Heap**
- *Intuition*: With the meeting rooms sorted in ascending order of start times, we can maintain a min-heap of end times for the rooms occupied. 
  - Insert first meeting's end time to heap. 
  - Iterate over the rest of meeting times:
    - If the new new meeting start time is less than the top of the min heap, then we need a new room. Increment room count, and push the new end time to the heap. 
    - Else, replace the top of the heap with the new meeting end time. 
  - Return count or length of the heap. 
- Time Complexity: 
  - $O(n\log n)$: Sorting. 
  - $O(n\log n)$: Heap push/pop $O(\log n)$ for each iteration. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
