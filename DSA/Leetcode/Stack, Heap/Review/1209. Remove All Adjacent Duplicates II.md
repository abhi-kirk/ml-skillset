**Brute Force**
- Iterate over string and check for consecutive duplicates. 
  - If yes, remove from string. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n^2/k)$
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$. 

---

**Stacks**
- *Intuition*: Maintain a freq map (as an array) in the stack. 
- Iterate over string:
  - Check if the ch already exists in the top of the stack map. 
    - If no, append it with freq as 1. 
    - If yes, increment the freq. Then check if the freq has reached `k`. If yes, pop the freq map from the stack. 
- Convert freq maps to strings, and join. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
