**Brute Force**
- Create a hashmap for words and frequency. 
- Use `sorted` function, with the `key` argument as the reverse of the key, value pair - to sort in descending order. 
- Return the top k elements. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n\log n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.

**Max Heap**
- Create a hashmap for words and frequencies. 
- Create a list of tuples with the first tuple element as the negative of freq and the second as the key/word from the hashmap.
- Convert to a heap: this will be a max heap because we took the negative of freq. 
- Pop k times from the heap to get the words. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n + k\log n)$: $O(n)$ for hashmap and heap; we pop k times, and each pop is $O(\log n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
