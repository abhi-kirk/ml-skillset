**Sorting**
- Maintain a dict with key as player ID and value as score. 
- For reset, simply delete the corresponding key. 
- For top:
  - Extract all dict values.
  - Sort in descending order. 
  - Sum the first K elements and return. 
- Time Complexity:
  - `addScore()`: $O(1)$
  - `reset()`: $O(1)$
  - `top()`: $O(n + n\log n)$

---

**Heap**
- For top:
  - Extract all dict values and multiply by -1 (for max-heap). 
  - Heapify. 
  - Pop the values K times, sum and return. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n + n + 2n\log K)$.
