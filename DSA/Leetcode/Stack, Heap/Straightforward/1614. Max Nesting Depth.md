**Stacks**
- *Intuition*: Count the number of successive open brackets (ignoring any characters which are not brackets). 
- Iterate over characters:
  - If open bracket, push to stack. 
    - Increment depth counter. 
    - *Max-depth counter is the max of depth and max-depth.*
  - If close bracket, pop from stack. 
    - Decrement depth counter. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.

**No Stacks**
- In the above solution, no need to push and pop from stack. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
