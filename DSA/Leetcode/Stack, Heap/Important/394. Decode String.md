**Stacks**
- *Intuition*: Solve inner/sub-problem first and move outwards while building the solution. 
- Iterate over the string and take the following steps:
  - Append to stack until first `]` is found. 
  - When `]` is found, pop from stack until `[` is found. Append these chars to substring. 
  - Pop once more to pop `[`. 
  - Pop from stack, and append to multiplier (str) while top of the stack is a digit. 
  - Multiply multiplier to substring, and append to stack. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Note: The constant in the above two complexities will depend on the multipliers.
