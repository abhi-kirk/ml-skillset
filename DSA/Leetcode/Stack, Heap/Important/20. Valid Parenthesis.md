**Stacks**
- Create a map for open/close brackets. 
- Iterate over all elements in string. 
- If element is opening bracket, push to stack. 
- If element is closing bracket
    - Stack cannot be empty, and
    - Element should pair with the top-most stack bracket.
- After loop, Stack should be empty. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$: Worst case of stack storage when all elements are opening brackets.
