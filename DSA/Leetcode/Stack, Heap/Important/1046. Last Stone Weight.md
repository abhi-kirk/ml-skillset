**Brute Force**
- In a loop:
  - Sort the array. 
  - Pop twice to get the largest two elements. 
  - If not equal, then append the difference to the array. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$: $O(n\log n).O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**Heap/Priority Queue**
- Python has the min-heap data structure as `heapq`; however we want a max-heap. Hence we multiply all elements of the array with `-1`. 
- Heap can add and remove the max/min values with $O(\log n)$ time. 
- We convert the array to heap, and repeat the first approach (with heap methods to pop and append). 
- Note: Appending the difference value will be done by first converting the element to positive, taking difference, and then turning them negative again. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n\log n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$: in python, converting to heap is done in-place.
