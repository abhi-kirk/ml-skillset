**Convert to Array**
- Iterate over linked list, and append node values to array.
- Check if array is palindrome by reversing the array `list[::-1]`, and compare with original. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$
  - Iterating over linked list is $O(n)$, 
  - Each writes to array is $O(1)$, 
  - Slicing operation: $O(n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$
