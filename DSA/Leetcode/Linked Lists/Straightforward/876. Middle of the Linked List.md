**Middle Pointer**
- *Intuition*: Keep a running track of the middle node with a counter (initialized to 1):
  - Observe that the middle will only increment when counter is odd. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**Fast Pointer**
- *Intuition*: While iterating with a slow pointer, have a fast pointer iterate twice as fast (`next.next`). 
  - When the fast pointer reaches end of list, then the slow pointer must be in the middle. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
