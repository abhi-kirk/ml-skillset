**Hash Maps**
- Iterate over the list, keep adding nodes to a `set`. 
- If element already exists, return the corresponding node. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.

**Floyd's Algorithm**
- *Tortoise and Hare*
  - Step 1: Iterate over the list with two pointers `tortoise` and `hare`, where `hare` is twice as fast as the `tortoise`. 
    - If they don't land on the same node, then there is no cycle. 
    - If they do land on the same node `intersect`, proceed to Step 2.
  - Step 2: Initialize two more pointers `p1` and `p2`, where `p1` is at the list head and `p2` is at `intersect`. 
    - Iterate both pointers. 
    - When they land on the same node, then that is the node where the cycle starts. 
- Check for edge cases:
  - List has zero or a single node. 
  - The `hare` cannot take two steps.
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
  - In case when a cycle is present, if it took $x$ steps to complete Step 1, then it will take $(n-x)$ steps to complete Step 2, where $n$ is the length of the list. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
