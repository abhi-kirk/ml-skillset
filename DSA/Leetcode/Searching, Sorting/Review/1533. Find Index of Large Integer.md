**Binary Search**
- Apply BS template:
  - Based on if search space length is even or odd, modify arguments to `compareSub()` such that we have equal number of elements on both sides. 
  - `condition`: find the leftmost element such that right side is bigger than the left side. 
- Time Complexity: $O(\log_2 n)$: Hence maximum number of calls to API is $\log_2 (5*10^5) < 19$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
