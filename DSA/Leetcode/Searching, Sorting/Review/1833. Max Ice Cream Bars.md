**Sorting**
- Sort the costs array. 
- Iterate over the sorted array and decrease the cost by array element till no money left. 
  - Return loop index. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n\log n + n) = O(n\log n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$: Sorting in place in python.

**Count Sort**
- Use *count sorting* to create a freq-array where:
  - Index is the value in the original array, 
  - Value is the frequency of the value in original array. 
- Initialize the freq-array with 0-value array of length $m+1$, where $m$ is the max of the costs array. 
- Iterate over costs array (len $n$) to create freq-array using *count sorting* method. 
- Iterate over freq-array, and: 
  - If value is not zero and have sufficient money to buy at least one ice-cream:
    - Calculate number of ice-creams that can be bought: either all of them, or the quotient of (coins left, cost of ice-cream). 
    - Update coins left by subtracting the product of (number of ice-creams bought, cost of ice-cream). 
    - Update number of ice-creams bought so far. Return this value after the loop finishes. 
- Time Complexity: $O(2n+m)$: $O(n)$ for taking max, $O(n)$ for building freq-array, and $O(m)$ for final loop. 
- Space Complexity: $O(m)$.
