**Looking for a Range: Two Binary Searches**
- First search for the leftmost `target` position. 
  - Apply BS template with `condition`: find the leftmost element that is greater than or equal to `target`. 
- Handle edge cases where the above position is not found, or the element next to the found element is not the same, or the last element is the same as the found element. 
- Second search for the rightmost `target` position with modified search space starting from the found position. 
  - Apply BS template with `condition`: find the leftmost element that is not equal to the first element. 
- Time Complexity: $O(\log n)$: implemented twice. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
