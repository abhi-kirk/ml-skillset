**Feasible BS**
- *Intuition*: 
  - If given some capacity, we can tell if it's possible to ship all weights in D days or not. 
  - Hence, over a capacity search space (increasing in order), the objective is to find the least capacity that we can have. 
- Write a method for capacity feasibility given some capacity. Use this as the `condition`. 
- Apply BS template with `condition`: find the leftmost capacity that is feasible in the number of days given. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n\log n) + O(n)$ = $O(n\log n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
