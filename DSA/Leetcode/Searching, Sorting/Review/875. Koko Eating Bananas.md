**Check Feasible**
- For a given speed we can calculate if Koko can eat all bananas within `h` hours or not. 
  - Hence write a method for feasibility and use as `condition` for BS. 
- Apply BS template with above `condition` to search for the least speed required in the speed search space. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n\log n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
