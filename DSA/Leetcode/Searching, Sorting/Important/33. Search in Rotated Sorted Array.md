**Two-Pass Binary Search**
- First pass: Find Pivot
  - Apply BS template with `condition`: find the leftmost element that is less than the first element. 
- Second pass: Find target
  - Apply BS template with `condition`: find the leftmost element that is greater than or equal to the pivot. 
  - Use modified search spaces - either to the left or right of pivot. 
- Time Complexity: $O(\log n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
