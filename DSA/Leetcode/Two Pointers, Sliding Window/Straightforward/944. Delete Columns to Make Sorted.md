**Brute Force**
- Outer loop iterates over characters. 
- Inner loop iterates over strings. 
- Use `ord` to check for any decreasing ASCII character values. 
  - Keep track of number of violations. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n.m)$, where $n$ is the string length, and $m$ is the number of strings. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
