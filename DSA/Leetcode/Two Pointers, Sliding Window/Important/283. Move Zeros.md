**Brute Force 2-pointer**
- Initialize slow pointer as 0. 
- Iterate over array with fast pointer. 
- With slow pointer:
  - If zero is found, `pop` the element and `append` to the end. 
  - If zero not found, increment slow pointer. 

---

**Optimal 2-pointer**
- *Intuition*: 
  - A fast pointer iterates over the array, and a slow pointer keeps track of the very first zero index. 
  - Any time a non-zero element is found, it is swapped with the slow pointer element. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
