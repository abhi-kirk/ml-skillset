**Brute Force**
- First loop: store all vowels in a list (queue). 
- Reverse the list. 
- Second loop: replace all vowels with those in the list. 
- Time Complexity: $O(3n):=O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$: when all elements are vowels.

**Two Pointers**
- *Intuition*: 
  - Two pointers will run through the array, in opposite directions, from left and right, respectively. 
  - When both pointers are on a vowel, we replace the vowels. 
- Start `while` loop until `left` pointer is less than `right`. 
- Swap elements if both pointers on vowels. 
  - Increment both pointers (opposite directions). 
  - If `left` not a vowel, increment `left`. 
  - If `right` not on a vowel, increment `right`. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$: when no vowels present. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$: in-place.
