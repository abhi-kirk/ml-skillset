**Vertical Scanning**:
- *Intuition*: 
  - Stacking string vertically. 
  - Outer loop to iterate over first string characters, and inner loop to iterate over rest of the strings. 
  - Check exit conditions. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n.m)$, where $n$ is the number of strings, and $m$ is the length of first string. 
  - Can potentially sort the array in ascending order first. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
