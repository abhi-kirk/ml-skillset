**Sliding Window**
- *Intuition*: Create a hashmap of `p`, and compare with a sliding window hashmap from `s`. 
- Instead of creating a dict manually, one can use `collections.Counter` method to get a hashmap from an array directly. 
- When creating the sliding window map:
  - Initialize the map for the first iteration. 
  - For future iterations:
    - Subtract from the frequency of the element *left behind*. Delete key if frequency is zero. 
    - Add to the frequency of the element *being included*. Insert they key if not present already. 
- Edge case: when `p` is longer than `s`. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of `s`. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$ since the largest length of any map is 26.
