**Sliding Window**
- *Intuition*: Create an expanding window and check if window is valid or not. Move window forward if invalid. 
- Algorithm:
  - Starting from left, expand the window size by iterating over `s`. 
  - For each window:
    - Update a frequency hashmap, 
    - Take the max of the map values, 
    - Check condition that the sum of values except corresponding to the max is less than `k`. 
    - If yes, keep track of the max (valid) window size. 
    - If no, move window forward. 
    - Update hashmap. 
  - Return the max valid window size. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$: with a high constant due to:
  - Taking the max of the map, 
  - Sum of values except the max, 
  - Updating the map. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
