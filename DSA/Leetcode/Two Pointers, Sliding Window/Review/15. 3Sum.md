**Using Two Sum II**
- For each element, implement Two Sum-II approach for the rest of the elements. 
  - Hence sort the array first. 
- Skip duplicate elements while iterating the array since duplicates are not allowed in the result. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n\log n) + O(n^2)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$: Sorting.
