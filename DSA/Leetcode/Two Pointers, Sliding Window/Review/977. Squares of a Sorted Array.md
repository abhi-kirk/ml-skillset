**Two Pointers ($O(n)$)**
- *Intuition*: Similar to the question where two sorted arrays need to be merged (which in turn is similar to merging of sorted linked lists). In that case:
  - Each pointer is at the beginning of each sorted array. 
  - Compare the pointer values, and append the smallest to the resulting array. 
  - Increment the pointer for the array where value is taken. 
  - When an array is finished, concatenate rest of the other array to result. 
- In this question there are also two sorted arrays: the negative one in decreasing order, and the positive one in increasing. 
- Hence we start at the ends of the increasing-sorted arrays, i.e. first pointer is at the beginning and second is at the end. 
- Initialize a 0-value result array since we will fill it backwards (comparing the greatest elements from the two arrays). 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$ where the output is not taken into account.
