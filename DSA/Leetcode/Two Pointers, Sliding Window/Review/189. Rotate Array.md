**$O(n)$ space**
- Create a result array with the answer. 
- Copy each element from result array to `nums`. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$: technically $O(2n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Done in-place.
  - Same thing can be achieved with simply splicing the `nums` array for `k` and `n-k` lengths.  

---

**$O(1)$ space**
- Rotate the entire array in-place. 
- Rotate the first `k` elements in-place. 
- Rotate the last `n-k` elements in-place. 
- In-place rotation:
  - Two pointers: One at start, other at the end of the array. 
  - Swap places. 
  - Increment and decrement the first and second pointers, respectively. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
