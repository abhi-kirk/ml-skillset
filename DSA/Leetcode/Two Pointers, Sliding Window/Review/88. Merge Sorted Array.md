**Brute Force**
- Insert the second array into the first. 
- Sort in-place with a built-in method. 
- Time Complexity: $O((n+m)\log (n+m))$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$. 

---

**Three Pointers**
- Make a copy of the first array. 
- Use three pointers:
  - First points at the array copy. 
  - Second points at the second array. 
  - Third points at the first array in a `for` loop. 
- Compare copy pointer and second array pointer to update the first pointer elements. 
- Take care of the exit conditions and edge cases. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n+m)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(m)$.
