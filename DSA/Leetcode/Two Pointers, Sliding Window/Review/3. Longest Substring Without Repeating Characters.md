**Sliding Window**
- *Intuition*: 
  - Start a sliding window (i.e. left and right pointers in given string), and keep expanding to the right. 
  - Maintain a set for all chars encountered. 
  - If a duplicate is found:
    - Shrink window from left up till (and *excluding*) the duplicate. 
    - Keep removing elements left behind. 
  - Keep track of max window length. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$: set length: worst case is all unique elements.
