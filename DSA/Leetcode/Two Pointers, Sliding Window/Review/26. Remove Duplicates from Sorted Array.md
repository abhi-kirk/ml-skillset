**Brute Force**
- Iterate with `while` loop till `_` is found in the string. 
- Inside the loop, check consecutive elements for duplicates. 
  - If duplicate found, `pop` the element, and `append` `_` to the end of string. 
  - If not found, increment the loop index. 
- Keep track of number of pop/appends, and return difference with length of string. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$: Insertion and deletion from list is $O(n)$ for arrays. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**Two-Pointer**
- Iterate over all elements in string. Use two indexes:
  - `read`: Iterates over the array. 
  - `write`: Keeps track of the position where the unique value needs to be written in the array. 
- Since the first value is always unique, we initialize both pointers at 1. 
- Compare `read` with `read-1`: if True, do the write and increment `write`. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
