**Brute Force / Hash Maps**
- Create symbol to int map
- While loop to iterate over all elements
- If-Else conditions to iteratively add. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$ assuming arbitrary number of symbols, and assuming looking up value fo each symbol is $O(1)$. 
    - If we consider an upper limit for possible sum to be 3999, then the "worst-case" time complexity is $O(1)$. 
    - From Leetcode comment: *If you plot a Big O - graph, you would see the line increase linearly until element (x-axis) hit 3999. At that point, the line would go flat (technically it stops), so you can never do more operations (y-axis) then that point. Since Big O takes worst case, and worst case is a 'flat' line after 3999, you're talking constant time. O(1). (or cheat code: flat line = constant time)*
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
