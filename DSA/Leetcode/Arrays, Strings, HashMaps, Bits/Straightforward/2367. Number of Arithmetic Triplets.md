**Hash Maps**
- Create a hash map with key as array element and value as the difference between element and `diff`. 
- Iterate over array:
  - Check if first difference and second difference are both present in map keys, then increment result integer. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
