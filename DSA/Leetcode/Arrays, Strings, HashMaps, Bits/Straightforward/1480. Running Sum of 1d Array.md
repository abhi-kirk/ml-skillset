**Brute Force**
- Loop over all elements.
- Keep track of running sum, starting from 0. Append the sum to list, starting from empty. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.

**In-Place**:
- Loop over all elements. 
- To the current element, add the last element. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
