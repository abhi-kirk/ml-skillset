**Hash Maps**
- Iterate over elements and check if exist in map or not. 
  - If yes, also check the extra condition on indices. Return True if satisfied. 
    - Update map value since there can be more than 2 duplicates and the condition will need to be checked on the last two duplicates (since condition is an upper bound on the distance between indices). 
  - If no, update map value with index. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
