**Hash Maps**
- Create a hash map as frequency counter. 
- For each letter in map, check remainder of letter count. Decrease the letter count, and increment the palindrome length, as appropriate. 
  - Remove the letter from map if letter count reaches 0. 
- Check for any possible middle palindrome letters by checking the map. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$: The map can only be max 52 keys in length.

**Sets**
- Initiate a set. 
- Loop over letters. Add letter to set if it doesn't exist. 
- If it exists, remove letter from set and increment result by 2. 
- After loop, check for any possible middle palindrome letters by checking the set length. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$. 
- Faster and less space than previous approach since frequency counter is not created a-priori.
