**Naive**
- Iterate over range indexed at 1. 
- Check conditions on remainder and fill the stack. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**String Concat**
- Don't use `if-elseif`; create conditions for `if` and concatenate to current string in loop (initialized to empty).  
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**Hash Maps**
- Optimization (on code maintainability only) over String Concat. 
- Create dict with keys as divisors and values as string concats. 
- Loop over all keys (outer loop is still over the range) to check for conditions. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
