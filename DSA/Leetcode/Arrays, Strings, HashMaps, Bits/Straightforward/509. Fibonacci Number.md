**Recursion**
- Call itself by adding last two calls. 
- Time Complexity: $O(2^n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$: Call Stack. 

---

**Iterate with List**
- Iterate over `range` of `n`. 
- Create the fibonacci sequence by adding last two elements. 
- Return the last element. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$. 

---

**Iterate without List**
- Iterate over `range` of `n`. 
- Keep track of last two elements, and update them in the loop. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$. 

---

**Closed-Form Solution**
- Closed-form solution (*Binet's Formula*) with *Golden Ratio* $GD = (1+\sqrt{5})/2$:
$$F(n) = \frac{(GD)^n}{\sqrt{5}}$$
- Time Complexity: $O(\log n)$: Taking power. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
