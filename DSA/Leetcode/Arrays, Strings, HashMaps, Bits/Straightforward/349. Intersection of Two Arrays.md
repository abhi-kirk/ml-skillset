**Sets**
- Convert the lists to sets. 
- Iterate over the smaller set: all elements that are present in larger set, append them to a list. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the larger set.
  - Technically it's $O(n + 2m)$, where $m$ is the length of the smaller set. We do two operations of list to set conversion which is linear time, and one loop with the smaller set. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.

**Two Pointers**
- *Intuition*: If the arrays are sorted, then use a pointer for each array and compare elements. Check condition for resulting array uniqueness. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n\log n)$ if not sorted; $O(n)$ if already sorted. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
