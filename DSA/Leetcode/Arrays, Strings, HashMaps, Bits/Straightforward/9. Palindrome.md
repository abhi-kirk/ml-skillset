**Convert to String**
- Compare str and its reverse. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$: `int` to `str` datatype conversion. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
- $n$ is the number of digits. 

---

**Cannot Convert to String, and Overflow limitation**
- The below solution does not create the reversed integer, hence avoiding the overflow issue. 
- Return false if $<0$, true elif $<10$. 
- Create a list with all digits using quotient and remainder. 
- Check if list is same as reversed list. 
- Time/Space Complexity: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of digits. 
- If $n$ is the actual number:
  - Time Complexity: $O(log_{10}n)$ since we divide the input by 10 for every iteration.
