**Hash Maps**
- Iterate over the length of one of the strings, and create two hash maps:
  - Key is the character from respective strings, 
  - Value is frequency. 
- Compare the hash maps. 
- Can use `Collections.Counter()`.
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$: Max length of any hash map will be 26 (if no unicode characters). If unicode, max length is still constant.
