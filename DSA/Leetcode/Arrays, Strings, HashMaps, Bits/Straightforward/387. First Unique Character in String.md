**Hash Map**
- Iterate over string and create a hash map with keys as string elements, and values as their frequency. 
- Iterate over string with *another* loop, and check if string element frequency (from the map) is 1. 
  - If yes, return with the loop index. 
  - If loop finishes, return -1. 
- Time Complexity: $O(2n) := O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$ since english alphabet contains 26 letters.
