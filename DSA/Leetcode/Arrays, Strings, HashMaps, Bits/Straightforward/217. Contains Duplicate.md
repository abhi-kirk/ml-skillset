**Brute Force**
- Two loops:
  - Outer loop ($i$) over all elements, 
  - Inner loop ($j$) over all elements preceeding outer loop. 
- Check if $i^{th}$ elem equal to $j^{th}$: return True (duplicate found). 
- Both loops completed, return False (no duplicate found). 
- Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$. 
- Space COmplexity: $O(1)$.

**Convert to Set**
- Compare list length with length of set (converted from list). 
- Not a good method for real-world data since we have to first add each element to the set without considering if a duplicate has already been found. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$: conversion of list to set. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$: set is saved in memory.  
---

**Sorting**
- Sort the list. 
- Loop over elements and check for consecutive duplicates. 
- Time Complexity: $O(nlog\space n)$: *Timesort* algorithm based on *Merge sort*. This performance is worse than $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$: if sorting is done in-place.

**Hash Maps**
- Create a new empty map and loop over all elements. 
- If element is not in map keys, add it, else return True. 
- After loop finishes, return False (no duplicate found). 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$: looping over all elements. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$: map is in memory.
