**Two Dictionaries**
- Map the characters of the two strings to two individual hash maps, with key as character and value as index list. 
- Iterate over any one of the map values, and check if that list does not exist in the other map's values. 
- Time Complexity: $O(2n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$: Length of ASCII characters is small and finite.
