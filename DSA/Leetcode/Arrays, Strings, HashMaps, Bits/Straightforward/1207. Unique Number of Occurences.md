**Hash Maps**
- Iterate over all elements
- Update a dict where keys are the elements and values are the number of occurrences
    - If element not in dict keys, insert it, 
    - If element in dict keys, increment dict value by 1. 
- Convert list of values to set, and compare len of set with len of list of values. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$: dict is stored with worst case len same as number of elements in array.
