**Divide by 2**
- Edge cases: $n=0$ and $n=1$. 
- Run a `while` loop and keep dividing by 2. 
  - If remainder not 0, return False. 
  - Else if quotient is 1, return True. 
  - Else update as quotient. 
- Time Complexity: $O(\log n)$: Dividing by 2. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**Check if integer**
- Check if $x = \log_2 n$ is an integer with `x == int(x)`. 
- Time Complexity: $O(1)$: Taking $\log$ is constant time. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**Bitwise Brute Force**
- Intuition: 
  - A power of 2 will always only have a single 1-bit in its binary representation. 
  - A number not a power of 2 will have multiple 1-bits. 
  - Examples: $1 = (001)_2; 8 = (1000)_2; 6 = (110)_2$. 
- Remove a single 1-bit from the binary representation. 
  - If another 1-bit exists, return False. Else return True. 
- Time Complexity: $O(\log n)$: `bin` operator. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**Bitwise with 2's complement**
- *2's Complement*: 
  - Method used by computers to store negative numbers. 
  - Denoted by $\bar{x}$ for the 2's complement of $x$. 
  - The bits of $x$ are flipped and a 1 is added. 
  - Example: 
    - $6 := 0110$, 
    - $\bar{6} := 1001+1 = 1010 := -6$. 
- Intuition: 
  - ($x$ & $\bar{x}$) will result in zeroing out all bits except the right-most 1-bit. 
  - If $x$ is a power of 2, since $x$ can only have a single 1-bit, ($x$ & $\bar{x}$) = $x$. 
  - $x=0$ is handled as an edge case. 
- Time Complexity: $O(1)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
