**Hash map + List**
- *Intuition*:
  - If we keep a dict to store values, then randomization is not $O(1)$ since hash maps don't have indices. We will have convert hash map keys to list and then choose an element randomly. 
  - If we keep an array to store values, then deletion is not $O(1)$. 
  - Trick is to keep a separate list of values. 
- `init`: Initiate an empty list. 
- `insert`: Insert into a dict with value as the length of the list. 
  - $O(1)$. 
- `remove`: We have to update the list in $O(1)$ time. 
  - Swap the element and last element in the list, then pop the last element. 
  - Remove dict key. 
  - $O(1)$. 
- `getRandom`: Use `random.choice` on the list.
