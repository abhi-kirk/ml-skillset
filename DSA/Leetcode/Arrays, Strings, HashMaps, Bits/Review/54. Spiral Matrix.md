**Simulation**
- Traverse starting from `(0,0)` going right->down->left->up. 
  - After each traversal loop, we need to repeat the same for the remaining inside matrix. 
- Create individual loops for the four steps, keeping track of the four pointers: `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`. 
- Time Complexity: $O(m.n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
