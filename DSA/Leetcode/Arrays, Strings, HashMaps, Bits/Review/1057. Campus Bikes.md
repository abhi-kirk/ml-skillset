**Sorting**
- *Intuition*: 
  - Calculate distance for all possible combinations of workers and bikes. Track positions with `[worker_pos, bike_pos, distance]` pairs. 
  - Iterate over all pairs and track if worker/bike already visited. If not, add to result. 
- Time Complexity: $O(nm) + O(nm\log(nm)) + O(nm)$ = $O(nm\log(nm))$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(nm)$.
