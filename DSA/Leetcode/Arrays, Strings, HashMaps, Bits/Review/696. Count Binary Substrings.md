**Grouping Trick**
- *Intuition*: 
  - First group same consecutive digits together as a list with values as number of same consecutive digits. Example: `000110011 = [3, 2, 2, 2]`.
    - Can be done with `.replace("01", "0 1").replace("10", "1 0")`, then split and then take length of each split. 
  - Each consecutive group cannot have more valid substrings than their minimum. Hence create another list with the minimum of consecutive groups. 
  - Sum this list to get the total number of valid substrings. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
