**Pointer**
- Initiate a list of Nones with the length of list provided in first call.
- Initialize pointer to 0. 
- For every subsequent call:
  - Decrement the id by 1 so it's 0-indexed. 
  - Insert the value to the list at the id position. 
  - if id < pointer, return empty list. 
  - Else: 
    - Increment the pointer until the last element before None. 
    - Return sub-list from the list: index to pointer.
