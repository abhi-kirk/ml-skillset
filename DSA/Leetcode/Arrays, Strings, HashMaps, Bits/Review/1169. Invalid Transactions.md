**Brute Force**
- Create separate lists for names, times, amounts and cities. 
- We need indices of `transactions` where it's invalid. 
  - This resolves the issue with coming up with double instances of same transaction. 
  - Double for-loop to compare each transaction element with the rest. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
