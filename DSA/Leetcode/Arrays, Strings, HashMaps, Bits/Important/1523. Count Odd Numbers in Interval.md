**Brute Force**
- Check if `low` is odd; if not assign `skip=1` otherwise `skip=2`. 
- Loop with `range` `low` to `high` and `skip`. Count the number of iterations. 
- Above method is equivalent to checking the length of the `range`. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$, where $n = \text{high} - \text{low}$. 
- SPace Complexity: $O(1)$.

**Difference**
- Check if `low` is odd; if not increment by 1. 
- Return the difference between `high` and `low` divided by 2, and increment by 1. 
- Time Complexity: $O(1)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
