**Intersect HashMaps**
- Create hashmaps for both `secret` and `guess`, with keys as array elements and values as a set of their indices.  
- Iterate over the `guess` map, and:
  - Check if key exists in `secret` map's keys. If yes, then we either have a bull or a cow. 
    - Take intersection of the two sets (values in the maps). 
    - The length of intersection will be the increment to bulls. 
    - Min of remaining set lengths will be the increment to the cows. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$: Creating hash maps. Note that the loop to increment bulls/cows is $O(1)$ since the map cannot be more than 10 in length. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$: The hashmaps have a max length of 10.
