**Left and Right Products**
- Same pattern as the one used for Trapping Rain Water. 
  - Pre-compute running left-side products, and right-side products. 
  - For each array position multiply left-side product and right-side product. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$: 3 times. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
