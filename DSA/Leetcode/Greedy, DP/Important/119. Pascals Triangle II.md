**Brute Force**
- Solution structure is the same as *Pascal's Triangle*:
  - Iterate over rows to build the triangle, and return the row corresponding to the problem argument. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of rows. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.

**Math**
- Pascal's Triangle Property:
  - Element at $n^{th}$ row and $r^{th}$ column is given by $\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$. 
  - Hence the successive elements $\binom{n}{r-1}$ and $\binom{n}{r}$ differ by: 

  $$\frac{\binom{n}{r-1}}{\binom{n}{r}} = \frac{n-r+1}{r}$$

  - Thus we can derive the next term in a row using the preceding term (DP), given the observations:
    - All rows start with 1, 
    - The length of the $n^{th}$ row is always $n+1$. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
