**Brute Force**
- For every element:
  - Calculate max of elements to the right (including self), 
  - Calculate max of elements to the left (including self), 
  - Water trapped is the min of the above two, with the height of self subtracted. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**Max So Far**
- Instead of calculating the left/right max on the fly, we pre-compute them in two additional (individual) loops. 
- Initiate empty arrays for left-max and right-max. 
- To fill left-max array, loop forward (starting at 1), and for each element:
  - Take the max of previous element in original array and the previous element in the max-array. 
- Fill the right-max array similarly but looping backwards (starting at n-2). 
- Loop over the original array and for each element take the min of corresponding left-max and right-max arrays. 
- Calculate water trapped by subtracting self (if the difference is greater). 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$: three times. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$ two times.
