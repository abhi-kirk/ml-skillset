**Greedy Approach**
- If `armor` is less than the `max-damage`, then we can block any of the `damages` more than or equal to `armor`. 
  - Hence sum the `damage` and subtract the `armor`. 
- If `armor` is more than the `max-damage`, then we should only block the `max-damage`. 
  - Note that the `armor` can only be used once. 
  - Hence sum the `damage` and subtract the `max-damage`. 
- Add one to keep health above 0. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$: Taking `max`. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**One-Liner**
- Without armor, we will need health `sum(damage) + 1`. 
- So we need to find how much armor can protect us and subtract from above. 
  - We should use the armor when there is max damage: `max(damage)`. 
  - The armor applied will be the smaller of armor ability and damage when it is applied: `min(max(damage), armor)`. 
- Hence health needed: `sum(damage) + 1 - min(max(damage), armor)`. 
- Same complexity as above.
