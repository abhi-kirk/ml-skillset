**Iterate**
- Outer loop (`i`) iterates over the length of the triangle, starting from 1, and will fill up each row of the triangle.  
- Inner loop (`j`) iterates over the elements of the row, starting from 1 and ending with `i`. 
  - Using the previous row in the triangle, calculate the sum of `j-1` and `j`th elements. 
  - Append sum to the current row. 
  - Append 1 at the end of loop. 
- Append row to triangle. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of rows. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
