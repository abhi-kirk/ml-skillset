**DP**
- *Hypothesis*: If $n$ is even alice wins. 
- *Proof*:
  - If alice gets an even number for $n$, she can always convert it to an odd number by choosing $x=1$. 
  - *Sub-hypothesis*: If $n$ is odd, player will lose. 
  - *Proof*:
    - If $n=1$, player loses automatically since no more $<n$ integers to choose from. 
    - If $n>1$ and $n$ is odd, then the only divisor player can choose has to be odd. 
    - Choosing odd $x$ will make $n-x$ even. 
    - The other player will keep choosing $x=1$ until this player has $n=1$ at which point he loses. 
- Time Complexity: $O(1)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
