**Brute Force**
- Two loops: 
    - Outer loop iterates over all elements except last. 
    - Inner loop iterates over all elements following outer loop. 
        - Calculate profit w.r.t. each future day.
        - Update the max-profit value (initialized to 0). 
- Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$: Too slow. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**Iterate Once**
- *Intuition*:
    - Keep track of the smallest element on the left - this is the buy price. 
    - Calculate profit by subtracting the current price (i.e. the sell price) from the smallest buy price. 
    - Keep track of the maximum profit. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**Iterate Twice**
- *Intuition*: 
  - For each price element (buy cost), calculate the highest price to its right (highest sell cost). 
  - Subtract sell costs from buy costs, and get max. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
