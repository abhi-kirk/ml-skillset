**Prefix Sum**
- *Intuition*: 
  - Traversing from the left, at any position `i`, the current sum will be `prefix_sum + nums[i]`.
  - If `prefix_sum` is negative, it will only decrease the current sum. 
  - Since we have to keep track of the max sum, `prefix_sum` does not add anything and hence is removed, i.e. re-initialized to 0. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
