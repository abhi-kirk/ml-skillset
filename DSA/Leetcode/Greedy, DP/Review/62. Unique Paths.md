- *Intuition*:
  - Fill the `mxn` grid with the number of possible paths to reach any particular cell. Then return the bottom-right cell. 
  - The only possibility for the first row to be in a path is when the path is unique (all rights then downs). Same is true for the first column. 
    - Hence the number of possible paths for these cells (first row and first column) is 1. 
  - For the rest of the cells, number of possible paths to `(i,j)` is equal to the sum of:
    - Number of possible paths from the cell above. 
    - Number of possible paths from the cell to the left. 
  - Sum is taken since both directions are possible for the robot to move from. 
- Time Complexity: $O(m.n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(m.n)$ to create the grid. 
  - Can be reduced if we update only a single row: $O(n)$.
