**[Memorize] Dynamic Programming**
- Similar to *Maximum Subarray* problem, we have to keep track of the maximum product for the subarray. 
- However this time we have to track the max and min both because of the negative elements. 
- The `0` edge case is handled by resetting the prefixes to 1. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

**Intuitive Trick**
- Step 1: Given array `A` containing no zeros, and assuming the max-product subarray contains either `A[0]` or `A[n-1]` (i.e., either the first or the last element):
  - Calculate running products (arrays) from left and right.
  - Concatenate the arrays and return the max. 
  - That is, the max-product for a subarray is contained in either of the running products. 
- Step 2: Proof for the assumption that max-product subarray contains either `A[0]` or `A[n-1]`. 
  - First hypothesize that we can always find a subarray `A[i..j]` whose product `P>0`. Proof:
    - Let `A[i]` be an arbitrary element. If it is positive, we are done. 
    - If `A[i]` is negative, consider its neighbors. If both neighbors are negative, we can take all three elements and hence `P` will be positive. If either one is negative, we can that element and `A[i]` to get a positive `P`. 
  - Again consider the neighbors of the positive-product subarray `A[i..j]`. 
    - If one of them is negative, then we can extend the array in the opposite direction. 
    - If both are positive, we can extend in either direction. 
    - Hence we can extend the array arbitrarily in some direction until we hit `A[0]` or `A[n-1]`. 
- Step 3: If `A` contains zeros, then the above steps are repeated for all partitions of `A` where the partition is made at `0`. Take the max of all partitions. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$ because of the storage for the running products.
