**Depth-First Search**
- Use recursion to:
  - Fill the pixel if the old color matches starting color. 
  - Calculate all four possible directions. 
  - Loop over all directions and check conditions (including direction pixel matching starting color), and fill the direction pixel. 
  - Call the recursive function with new position. 
- Use global variables wherever possible and keep recursive function arguments to a minimum. 
- Check edge case when starting pixel is the same color as the new color. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$: call stack.
