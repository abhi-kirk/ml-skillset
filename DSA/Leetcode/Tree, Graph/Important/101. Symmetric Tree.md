**Level-Order Traversal**
- Do BFS traversal to create the result array for all levels. 
  - Include `None` for empty child. 
- Iterate over the array, one level at a time. 
- Check if each level is symmetric by reversing the right portion and comparing. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n) + O(l)$ = $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes, and $l$ is the number of levels: since $n>l$ always. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
