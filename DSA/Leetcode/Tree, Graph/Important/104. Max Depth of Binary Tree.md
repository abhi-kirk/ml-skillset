**DFS**
- Calculate max depth of left sub-tree and right-subtree at each recursion call. 
- At each call increment depth. 
- Return depth. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$, where $n$ if the number of nodes. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$ for completely unbalanced tree. 
  - Example: Each node has only left child node.

**BFS**
- Return the length of the level traversal list. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
