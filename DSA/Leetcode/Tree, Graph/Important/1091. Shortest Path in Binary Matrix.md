**BFS**
- With shortest path problems, the solution most likely is always BFS using `collections.deque()`. 
- *Intuition*:
  - Objective is to find the depth of the tree till we reach the desired node (cell). 
  - Initialize a queue with the starting position. 
  - While the queue is not empty:
    - Pop the queue to get the node (matrix co-ordinates), 
    - Check if we are at the desired node, 
    - If not, check all neighbor nodes validity, 
    - If valid, assign incrementing distance to the neighbor node, 
    - Append the neighbor node to the queue. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$: where $n$ is the number of cell in the matrix since each node is traversed once. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$: space taken up by the queue.
