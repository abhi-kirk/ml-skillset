**Depth-First Search**
- Scan the matrix/grid. 
- If `1` is encountered, start a DFS with current node as root node:
  - Mark each visited node as `0`. 
  - For each root node, increment a counter for number of islands. 
- Time Complexity: $O(m.n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(m.n)$: worst-case recursion call stack if all grid elements are `1`s.
