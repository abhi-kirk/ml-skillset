**BFS from Sea**
- *Intuition*:
  - Iterate over matrix and initiate BFS for every sea element (i.e. add to the queue). 
  - Also mark the visited elements (i.e. append to a cell). 
  - Update the distance of 4-dirs by adding 1 to the current element. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n.m)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n.m)$: maintaining the queue.
