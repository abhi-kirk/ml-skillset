**Recursion**
- *Intuition*: For a node `n` to be LCA, `p` and `q` have to be on the opposite sides. Hence because it's a BST, if `p<q`, then `p<n<q`. 
- With either recursion or a while loop:
  - Check if `p` and `q` both are on left side of tree. If true, call function again with `node.left`. 
  - Check if `p` and `q` both are on right side of tree. If true, call function again with `node.right`. 
  - Else we have found the LCA which is the current "root" node. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
