**DFS**
- This solution is not BFS; rather it traverses the graph in DFS and compiles the answer to satisfy requirements. 
- Inner method gets two arguments: `node` and `level`, and is initialized with root and 0, respectively. 
- Method to create list of lists wrt levels:
  - At each recursion call, the `level` index of the array is accessed. Hence we need to create (initialize) an empty (sub-)list if it does not already exist. This is done by comparing with the length of the resulting array. 
- Check if left and right children exist, and call method recursively. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$: call stack.

**Use DeQue (FIFO)**
- Initiate a FIFO queue with `collections.deque`, and the return list `levels`.  
- Insert `root` into the queue with `level=0`. 
- Start `while` loop until queue is empty:
  - Get length of queue: this is the number of nodes in this level. 
  - With a for-loop, pop nodes from the queue (`queue.popleft()`), and insert their value in `levels[level]`. 
  - If node children exist, append to the queue. 
  - Increment `level`. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
