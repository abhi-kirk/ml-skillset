**Recursion**
- Initiate empty array as result. 
- Write a function with `node` as input. 
  - Return if `node` empty. 
  - Append `node` value to array. 
  - Call function with left child. 
  - Call function with right child. 
- Call function with root node. 
- Return result array. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$ due to $n$ call stack length.

**Stacks**
- Add root to empty stack. 
- Loop while stack is not empty:
  - Pop stack to get `curr_node` (initialized with root), and check if empty. 
  - Push right child to stack. 
  - Push left child to stack. 
- Note: Right child is pushed first since stack is FIFO. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$ for the stack.

**Morris Traversal**
- Same approach as Stacks, however, instead of using stacks:
  - When we reach the last node (leaf) in the left subtree, we assign the root node as its child. 
  - In this way we don't have to traverse back to find the root node. 
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. 
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
